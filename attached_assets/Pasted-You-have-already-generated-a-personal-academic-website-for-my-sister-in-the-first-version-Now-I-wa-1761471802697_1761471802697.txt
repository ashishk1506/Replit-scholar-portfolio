You have already generated a personal academic website for my sister in the first version.
Now, I want to update and enhance the existing website by adding missing academic details, research experience, publications, and achievements.

Goal: Keep the overall structure, design, and layout consistent, but enrich the site’s content with more details and professional polish.

Update Instructions:

Keep the Home / About section concise but mention her research focus: cancer biomarker isolation, microfluidic device design, and characterization of extracellular vesicles.

Expand the Education section to include:

Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering | University of Michigan Ann Arbor | GPA: 4.0/4.0 | 2021–Present

M.Tech + B.Tech (Hons.) in Chemical Engineering | IIT Kharagpur | GPA: 9.63/10 | 2016–2021

Add a Professional Experience section with project summaries:

Longitudinal profiling of glioblastoma EVs (Prof. Sunitha Nagrath & Dr. Adam Sonabend, Northwestern University) — includes optimization of microfluidic device and a pending patent.

Selective microfluidic capture of meningioma EVs (Prof. Sunitha Nagrath & Dr. Mark Youngblood) — includes RNA extraction, dPCR, and western blot workflows.

Study of neutrophil–glioblastoma EV interactions (Prof. Sunitha & Deepak Nagrath) — involves in-vitro and ex-vivo characterization of neutrophil response.

Add a Publications section with formatted citations (use bullet points or cards):

Nature Communications (2025), Advanced Materials Technologies (2025), Biosensors and Bioelectronics (2025), Matter (2024), Advanced Materials Technologies (2023).

Add a Patents section with this entry:

Provisional Patent US App. No. 63/754225 (2025): A Novel Immuno-affinity Based Microfluidic Device (MGM ExoChip) for Specific Capture of Extracellular Vesicles from Plasma of Meningioma Patients.

Add an Awards & Achievements section with items such as Presentation Awards (2023–2025), IIT Kharagpur Rank 1, Mitacs Globalink Internship, and S.N. Bose Scholarship.

Add Teaching & Mentoring section:

Graduate Student Instructor, ChE 460 (Fall 2024), Peer Mentor (2022–2023), Teaching Assistant, IIT Kharagpur (2020).

Add Outreach & Extracurriculars:

Roles at BIONIC (Biointerfaces Institute), F.E.M.M.E.S., Symposium Officer, Outreach Officer, and President of Chemical Engineering Association (IIT KGP).

Add Skills section in a clean multi-column layout:

Experimental (SEM, Western Blot, qPCR/dPCR, NTA, Cell Culture),

Equipment (Helios 650, Ultracentrifuge, ZE5 Analyzer, Rheometer, etc.),

Software (R, COMSOL, ANSYS Fluent, Aspen Plus, MATLAB, SolidWorks, GraphPad Prism).

Add Internship Experience:

Finite Element Analysis of Cells, University of Waterloo (2020).

Metal Anode Deposition Modeling, Purdue University (2019).

Ensure consistent formatting, responsive layout, and simple navigation between sections.

Update the color scheme to a professional academic palette (white base, blue/gray accent).

Preserve all previous design and structure — only extend or enhance; do not remove existing sections unless redundant.

After generating changes, output the updated source code (HTML/CSS/JS or React) ready for deployment as a ZIP.
