5. **Contact / Footer Section**
   - Add social icons and links:
     - LinkedIn: [placeholder for now]
     - Email: [placeholder]
     - University of Michigan homepage: [placeholder link]
   - Footer note: “© 2025 [Your Sister’s Name] | PhD Candidate, University of Michigan”

Make sure the design:
- Is mobile responsive.
- Uses semantic HTML5 (sections, articles, etc).
- Includes placeholder images for photo, banner, and publication covers.
- Looks elegant, similar to an academic researcher’s portfolio.
- Generates full downloadable source code (HTML, CSS, JS).
